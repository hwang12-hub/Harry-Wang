        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an entrepreneur who started my first company when I was a freshman in college. 
            That company grew into a music school that now has over 150 students learning drums and guitar. 
            I am passionate about building communities and creating opportunities for others to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year, I also started my own Equestrian Club, combining leadership, discipline, 
            and my interest in horseback riding.
